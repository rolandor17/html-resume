    <h1>My Top 5 Music Albums In No Particular Order</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Kendrick Lamar's <i>To Pimp A Butterfly</i></h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/tpab.jpg" alt="Album cover for Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly" height="200">
    <p>A thought-provoking album that talks about the struggles of a black man living in the hood and what they live through in their surroundings.
        I find it as a continuation of his previous record, <i>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City</i> which he goes in depth in the same struggles as this one. <br>
        The jazz influences (with the help of the talented Thundercat) we get a story that is being discussed from beginning to end, with each song adding
        an additional line to the poem that we get to hear completely in the last song, directing it towards Tupac which is a pioneer to what Kendrick Lamar wants
        to talk about.<br>
        My favorite songs from the record are: <i>How Much a Dollar Cost</i>, <i>Alright</i>, and <i>These Walls</i>.<br>
        PS: The greatest thing that came out from this album was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-7n6gCyyF8">live orchestra version of <i>These Walls</i></a>.

    <h2>Marvin Gaye's <i>What's Going On</i></h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/whatsgoingon.jpg" alt="Album cover for Marvin Gaye's What's Going On" height="200">
    <p>
        One of the greatest soul albums I've ever listened. The sequencing from each song exponentially improves the album to a level that requires you to always
        listen to the album from top to bottom. An album that is as spiritual and loving as this one, it is sad the way this great artist passed away by the hands
        of the person that brought him to this life in the first place.
        My favorite songs from the record are: <i>What's Going On</i>, <i>Mercy Mercy Me</i>, and <i>Inner City Blues</i>.

    <h2>C. Tangana's <i>El Madrileño</i></h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/madrileno.jpg" alt="Album cover for C.Tangana's El Madrileño" height="200">
    <p>
        A great folkloric album that even the artist, C. Tangana, recognizes its his best work and even is scared that there is no way to top it. Using many elements
        from previous spaniard artists and "modernizing it", this is for me one of the Magnum Opus in music in the 2020s. It released in 2021 and, as of 2025, we have not gotten
        a new album from this gentleman. I hope we get one pretty soon, but if not, the replayability from this album is incredible.<br>
        My favorite songs from the record are: <i>Cuándo Olvidaré</i>, <i>Tú Me Dejaste de Querer</i>, and <i>Ingobernable</i>. <br>
        PS: The greatest thing that came out from this album was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW6L_lTrIFg">Tiny Desk concert during the pandemic</a>.

    <h2>Tyler the Creator's <i>Flower Boy</i></h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/flowerboy.jpg" alt="Album cover for Tyler the Creator's Flower Boy" height="200">
    <p>
        Soul Hip-Hop has a soft spot in my heart, and this album is no exception to it. The cover art resembles the elements that get discussed in this album and
        in a beautiful manner. I replayed this album to an extreme way, and it still holds up to this day. Tyler's previous album, <i>Cherry Bomb</i>, feels like 
        it was the experiment to reach the perfection to what <i>Flower Boy</i> was. The following albums after this one has been pretty good and even <i>IGOR</i> I consider
        it a classic, but this one is still Tyler's best work.<br>
        My favorite songs from the record are: <i>Boredom</i>, <i>Garden Shed</i>, and <i>911/Mr. Lonely</i>.<br>
        PS: Thanks to this album I was introduced to a Spotify podcast that dissected line by line what the album is about (I'm sorry I overviewed the album in the description,
        it's been awhile since I heard the dissect podcast and the only song I remember's dissection that still holds up in my mind is <i>Garden Shed</i>). I will link to his Youtube Channel
        but I recommend the Spotify Podcast:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DissectPodcast/videos">Dissect Podcast</a>

    <h2>Bad Bunny's <i>Debí Tirar Más Fotos</i></h2>
    <img src="../assets/images/dtmf.jpg" alt="Album cover for Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más Fotos" height="200">
    <p>
        Bad Bunny's track record has been outstanding, with a net positive in the quality of his albums (He's not perfect, <i>Ultimo Tour</i> was not that good) and reached a point with this album
        that he has not reached with his previous ones: old people listen to it as well. Using many elements of Puerto Rican folklore's music (Plena, Bomba, Salsa) and with a message that anybody can relate to
        (Such as the self titled and <i>Baile Inolvidable</i>), people that were reluctant to listen to him because of how reggaeton is extremely sexual in its lyrics, now you get whole families
        singing to their songs in family events. I'll be honest though - this is not my favorite Bad Bunny album sonically. It doesn't take away that it holds a special place in my heart
        because of the location of where I listened to it.<br>
        I was in a study abroad program in 2024 staying in Salamanca, Spain. During december-january I held a eurotrip with friends I made during my study abroad that resulted in a broad group in nationalities;
        We had people from Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, and Spain. I listened to the album with the group in a hostel in Amsterdam. I enjoyed it thoroughly and was writing to my friends
        back in Puerto Rico how great the album is and the elements it brought to the table, thinking about how people worldwide could enjoy this album that is very "Puerto Rico-coded".<br>
        Fast forward two weeks and I arrive back to the apartment I was staying at in Salamanca. When I went out with some of my friends, we went to a bar and the music they were hearing? Bad Bunny's new album.
        Go to a club and the music they're hearing? Bad Bunny's new album. What were people hearing in their homes with their speakers very loud? Bad Bunny's new album. This turned the experience of being an "outsider"
        with people hearing the music I hear in my hometown in a daily basis. I found that very crazy, and to this day, very memorable. It's unbelievable the levels this album reached and I am curious on how it holds up
        the world in 5 years.<br>
        My favorite songs from the record are:<i>Baile Inolvidable</i>,<i>Kloufrens</i>, and <i>Voy a llevarte pa PR</i>.<br>
        PS: During Bad Bunny's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Me_Quiero_Ir_de_Aqu%C3%AD">Residency</a> I went a total of 4 times and would not mind if I could've gone again. It was that great.
